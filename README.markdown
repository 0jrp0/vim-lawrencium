Lawrencium
==========

Lawrencium is a [Mercurial][] wrapper for [Vim][], inspired by Tim Pope's [Fugitive][].


Disclaimer
----------

This plugin is still very young, and it's also the very first one I've ever written -- I'm basically learning Vim as I go along, so bear with me. Comments and help are all welcome.


Installation
------------

The recommended method to install Lawrencium is to use [Pathogen][], also from Tim Pope:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/ludovicchabant/lawrencium

You can then update the help tags with `:call pathogen#helptags()` and browse Lawrencium's help pages with `:help lawrencium`.
