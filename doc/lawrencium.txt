1.  Introduction                                *lawrencium-intro*

When a file from a Mercurial repository is open in a buffer, that buffer gets
new commands defined.

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

:Hg {args}              Run an arbitrary Mercurial command. Similar to :!hg
                        [args] but the '--repository' is automatically
                        specified with the root of the repository the current
                        file belongs to.

                                                *:Hg!*
:Hg! {args}             Like |:Hg|, but the output of the command is placed in
                        a temp file and edited in the |preview-window|.

                                                *:Hgcd*
:Hgcd[!] {path}         |:cd| relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *:Hglcd*
:Hglcd[!] {path}        |:lcd| relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *:Hgedit*
:Hgedit {file}          |:edit| {file} relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *:Hgedit!*

:Hgstatus               Shows the output of 'hg status' in the
                        |preview-window|.
                        You can navigate to the next/previous file with <C-N> 
                        and <C-P>, open a file with <cr>, diff the local file
                        with the parent revision with <C-D> and <C-V>,
                        depending on whether you want a horizontal or vertical
                        split window.

                                                *:Hgdiff*
:Hgdiff                 Diffs the current file against its parent revision.

                                                *:Hgdiff_f*
:Hgdiff {revspec}       Diffs the current file against the specified revision.

                                                *:Hgvdiff*
:Hgvdiff                Same as |:Hgdiff| but uses a vertical split.

                                                *:Hgvdiff_f*
:Hgvdiff {revspec}      Same as |:Hgdiff_f| but uses a vertical split.

                                                *:Hgcommit*
:Hgcommit               Opens a new window to edit a commit message into a
                        temporary file and, upon quitting the buffer, if that
                        file has been written to, commit the current changes
                        to the repository.

                                                *:Hgvcommit*

                        the commit message.
