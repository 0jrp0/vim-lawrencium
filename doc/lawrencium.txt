INTRODUCTION                                    *lawrencium*

When a file from a Mercurial repository is open in a buffer, that buffer gets
new commands defined.

COMMANDS                                        *lawrencium-commands*

All commands defined by |lawrencium| are local to each buffer.

                                                *lawrencium-:Hg*
:Hg [args]              Run an arbitrary Mercurial command. Similar to :!hg
                        [args] but the '--repository' is automatically
                        specified with the root of the repository the current
                        file belongs to.

                                                *lawrencium-:Hg!*
:Hg! [args]             Like |:Hg|, but the output of the command is placed in
                        a temp file and edited in the |preview-window|.

                                                *lawrencium-:Hgcd*
:Hgcd [directory]       |:cd| relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *lawrencium-:Hglcd*
:Hglcd [directory]      |:lcd| relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *lawrencium-:Hgstatus*
:Hgstatus               Shows the output of 'hg status' in the
                        |preview-window|.
